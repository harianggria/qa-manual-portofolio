# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Harimurti Dyan Anggriani

I have a background in **Engineer Support**, where I worked closely with users and technical teams to ensure smooth product experiences. Recently, Iâ€™ve been pivoting into **Quality Assurance (QA)**, building on my technical foundation and sharpening my testing skills through hands-on projects.

I had working on two QA projects (one from a bootcamp, and from other project), focusing on test planning, manual testing, and documentation.
Currently also learning and exploring automation using cypress.

## ðŸŽ¯ Areas of Focus

- Manual testing (feature validation & exploratory testing)
- Writing test cases and structured bug reports
- Basic API testing using Postman
- Organizing QA processes with tools like Google Sheets, Qase.io, and Notion

---

## ðŸ§ª QA Projects (WIP)

I'm in the process of finalizing:
- Test Plan documents
- Structured Test Case sheets
- Sample Bug Reports
- QA Documentation Summary

These will be published on my [QA Portfolio GitHub Pages](https://username.github.io/qa-portfolio) soon.
